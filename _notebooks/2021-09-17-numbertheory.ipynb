    "The next step is to determine if a number is prime. To make this function efficient, we can loop through divisors in the range from 2 to the square root of the number rounded up using the ceiling function from the math module and check whether that number is a factor. The mathematical intution behind this is that a number that is not prime will have at least one factor that is less than its square root (and one factor greater). So, if a number has no factors less than its square root, it must be prime. For example, let's take the number 11. The square root of 11 rounded up is 4, so the loop will run from 2 to 4. If there are no factors in that range, that 11 is prime, which is the case. I used this mathematical intuition because looping through all numbers in the range to the specified number is very inefficient, especially because we are working with such large numbers in this question.

    "First, we will make the iterable (input number) into a list of its digits as strings. For example, 1234 becomes ['1','2','3','4']. Then, we will create a window of a specified size for each element (digit) in the range of the number until a window of the specified size cannot be made. For example, if we want a window of size 3, we will loop through all the elements in range of the length of the list of digits minus the size of the window plus one. So, using our example, the loop will run from '1' to '2'. For each iteration, the window will be appeneded as a list to a list of windows. So, from our example, [['1','2','3'],['2','3','4']] will be the output from the loop. Next, we want to return a list of integers, so we will combine the digits into one number and convert to an integer. From our example, the output would be [123, 234]."
