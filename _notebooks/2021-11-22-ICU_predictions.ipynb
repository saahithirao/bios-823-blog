This function takes the four data frames as inputs, cleans and merges the data, and returns an analytic data frame to be used for modeling. The code below shows an example how the data frames were merged and how we dealt with missingness (code is not exhaustive). Using lists of top procedures and medications, we subsetted the relevant data frames to those lists and converted the data to a long format, so that procedures and prescriptions could be used as features (columns) in the model. We converted nas to 0 (patient did not have that procedure or medication) in these columns. Similarly, for our outcome of death, we converted nas to 0 because we could not confirm that that  patient had died. Using domain knowledge of diagnoses in the ICU that have a high likelihood of leading to death (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17083735/), we categorized diagnoses into four groups and labelled the remaining diagnoses as \"other\". We determined the top two wards that had the most deaths and labelled the remaining wards as \"other\".   \n",

    "I contributed to various components of this project. I helped with the feature engineering. I explored the data and specifically the missingness and decided how to deal with these values. For example, I relabelled nas in other in many of the columns and as 0 in the outcome column. Once the crosstables of prescriptions and procedures had been created, I helped with writing a function that would take the four dataframes of interest, merge and clean the data, and output an analytic dataframe. I helped merge the dataframes and confirm that the data looked like what we expected. I determined how to categorize diagnoses. Once we had the analytic dataframe, I ran the baseline modeling on the demo data. This involved processing the data and splitting into training and test sets before running several classification models. I converted categorical variables into dummy variables and ran the models. I compared the AUC and SD of each of the models, performed stacking, and grid search to determine the best parameters. I passed along the best parameters to be used for the full data. I created plots of the confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and learning curves. I saved the best model and used that to create a skeleton of model predictions in our dashboard until the full data could be used. I matched the user inputs to the model features by creating a dataframe from the user inputs that were in the same order and had the same number of features as in the model. This was long process because we didn't want the user inputs on the dashboard to look clunky, so we had to use a lot of if, else statements to create the dataframe. I, then, deployed the best model onto the dashboard that took the user inputs and would make a prediction of the probability of a patient dying in the ICU. I helped with publishing the dashboard.\n",

    "Through completing this project, I learned how to perform machine learning algorithms in python and improved both my content knowledge of classification models and python proficiency with running models and making predictions. It was difficult to prioritize work on this project along with many other group projects, but I learned to set goals for each of our team meetings and slowly chip away at tasks for the project to keep it moving. I learned to utilize the skill sets of my team members as some were good at envisoning the dashboard and its different components and some were comfortable working with big data sets and to build on my own strengths of thinking through how the analytic data should look and trying different analytic methods. This project was a good culmination of the course as we got to implement different concepts that we learned and had the freedom to create a data product of our choice. I enjoyed exploring \"real world\" data and the different features as it felt like we were tackling a very relevant problem. I also enjoyed problem solving to figure out how to best create the analytic data frame and how to make model predictions from user inputs."
